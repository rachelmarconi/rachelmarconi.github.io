        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>
          I'm an eager programmer who loves chewing on complex problems, and I'm also deeply
          interested in human stories. I dance along a spectrum from journalism to programming,
          sometimes as a full-time stringer and sometimes as purely a software developer. I've had
          the most fun in the middle: I've crafted deep-dive data stories, relying on R skills to
          bolster my conclusions, and I've built web components for huge news networks, taking
          requests from editors.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love local news and empowering residents to take action and stay informed in their local
          communities. I also love to hike and am always looking for a new niche cafe!
        </p>
