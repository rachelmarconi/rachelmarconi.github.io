        <h1>Hello! I'm Rachel, an interactives designer and developer.</h1>
        <p>
          I chew on complex problems. I make data human-legible and local-relatable. I love to learn
          new things and stretch the limits of what's doable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most recently, I built interactive visuals for the Urban Institute, a nonprofit in the
          policy research space. I worked on large data explorers and dashboards on teams with
          writers and designers, mid-sized rapid response features on a tight budget and timetable,
          and small, one-off charts and tables in Datawrapper for a quick-learning blog team.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got my start as a city council reporter with a computer engineering degree in rural
          Pennsylvania, then got a master's in journalism with a focus in data and web development,
          simultaneously covering health, business, and local life in Maryland. I made interactive
          experiences at USATODAY out of grad school before two years working with Svelte 4 and 5 at
          Urban.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm eager to dive into important work building ways for folk to understand the issues
          around them. I'm invested in humans. And the work is worth it.
        </p>
